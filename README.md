## Introduction

A regular expression to check a SemVer string.

## Requirements

- PHP 7.1 or higher.

## Installation

Install `Zerotoprod\RegexSemver` via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

```bash
composer require zero-to-prod/regex-semver
```

## Usage

```php
Zerotoprod\RegexSemver\RegexSemver::pattern;
```

## Local Development

This project provides a convenient [dock](https://github.com/zero-to-prod/dock) script to simplify local development workflows within Docker
containers.

You can use this script to initialize the project, manage Composer dependencies, and run tests in a consistent PHP environment.

### Prerequisites

- Docker installed and running
- A `.env` file (created automatically via the `dock init` command, if it doesn’t already exist)

### Initializing

Use the following commands to set up the project:

```shell
sh dock init
sh dock composer update
```

### Testing

This command runs PHPUnit inside the Docker container, using the PHP version specified in your `.env` file.
You can modify or extend this script to include additional tests or commands as needed.

```shell
sh dock test
```

Run the test suite with all versions of php:

```shell
sh test.sh
```

### Configuration

Before starting development, verify that your `.env` file contains the correct settings.

You can specify which PHP version to use for local development, debugging, and Composer operations by updating these variables in your `.env` file:

```dotenv
PHP_VERSION=8.1
PHP_DEBUG=8.1
PHP_COMPOSER=8.1
```

Make sure these values reflect the PHP versions you intend to use.
If the `.env` file does not exist, run the `sh dock init` command to create one from the `.env.example` template.
